Financial Planning Assumptions (Factor-Tilted Portfolio)
Year-end 2024

1. Introduction
This guide is intended to provide Canadian financial planners with our best estimates of future asset class
returns and volatilities to produce financial projections for their clients. This document assumes that investors
hold a broadly diversified portfolio of publicly traded global fixed-income securities and equity, including
developed and emerging stock markets. These estimates are valid uniquely in the context of an investor who
purposely avoids concentration in one or a few securities or sectors. Our investment horizon is 30 years.
Key inputs are highlighted in green for the NaviPlan financial planning software users. We have added an
appendix to provide users of NaviPlan with data presented in a more user-friendly format.
We have created this report specifically to help financial advisors who invest with mutual funds from
Dimensional Fund Advisors Canada. The asset class expected returns, standard deviations, correlations, and
distribution yields are designed to replicate the characteristics of the DFA Global Allocation funds. Importantly,
these characteristics account for the exposure of these funds to the Fama-French factors.

2. Expected Inflation
Our estimate for long-run Canadian inflation is the average of Canadian historical inflation from 1900 to
2023 and the Bank of Canada’s inflation target. These figures are 3.0% and 2.0%, respectively, for an inflation
expectation of 2.5%.

Research Institute, 2021, Bank of Canada

3. Primary Residence
We estimate the expected real capital return for personal residences at 1% annually. The carrying costs of
real estate, including maintenance, insurance, and property taxes, must also be captured. We estimate a 1%
annual cost for maintenance and insurance. As property taxes vary greatly, we do not attempt to prescribe
a figure here, but users should be sure to include them based on their circumstances. A 1% expected real
return, less maintenance and property taxes (not to mention the opportunity cost of home equity) may make
housing look like a poor investment. However, it is essential to remember that the owner receives imputed
rent as a benefit.

Haurin & Zhou (2010) documents the idiosyncratic volatility of individual homes from 1985 to 2003, and Peng
& Thibodeau (2016) cover the periods from 1996 to 2000, 2001 to 2007, and 2007 to 2012. We calculate an
average from these studies and add it to the general Canadian market volatility to obtain an estimate of 15%
for the volatility of Canadian homes, as documented in Table 2 below.

4. Expected Cost of Borrowing
Like our methodology for estimating the expected return of fixed-income assets, we estimate the expected
cost of borrowing from a combination of MBER and ECOC for five-year fixed-rate mortgages and secured and
unsecured personal lines of credit. Our results are summarized in Table 3.

5. Asset Class Expected Returns
We estimate asset class expected returns with a weighted average of the Market-Based Expected Return
(MBER) and the Equilibrium Cost of Capital (ECOC). The MBER is an estimate of expected returns based on
current market condition metrics. The ECOC estimates expected returns based on more than 120 years of
global asset class return historical data. The weighting of each component is derived from the statistical
explanatory power of the MBER. Empirical evidence suggests that the MBER has a high explanatory power for
fixed income and a relatively low (but significant) explanatory power for equity and cash instruments.
For each asset class, we attribute a weight “W1” to the MBER and the balance of the attribution “W2” to
the ECOC to obtain gross nominal asset class returns. We then subtract product MERs to obtain the net
nominal expected return. We use DFA F-class mutual fund MERs as our product fee assumption to factortilted portfolios. The corresponding funds to each asset class are outlined in the section “Composition of Asset
Class Returns.”

8. Composition of Asset Class Returns
The composition of asset class returns, primarily consisting of the mix of capital appreciation, interest income
and dividends, is essential for financial planning. The tax liability in taxable and non-taxable accounts (due to
foreign withholding tax) will hinge on the portion of returns assumed to be coming from interest, Canadian
and foreign dividends, and realized and unrealized capital gains.
To determine the composition of asset class returns, we proceed as follows:
• Establish one or more mutual funds or ETFs representing the passive benchmark for each asset class.
• For fixed income, the average distribution yield is assumed to be the lowest of the underlying fund’s
current yield and the asset class expected return. Distributions are assumed to be 100% interest
income.
• For Canadian equity, fund distributions are assumed to be 100% Canadian dividends.
• For US and international equity, fund distributions are assumed to be 100% foreign dividends.
• The balance of expected returns (net of distribution yields) is treated as capital gains.
• We assume a 90%/10% split between unrealized and realized capital gains.
We use the following funds to estimate the composition of asset class returns:
Fixed income: 100% DFA Global Fixed Income F (DFA916)
Canadian equity: 70% DFA Canadian Core Equity F (DFA256) and 30% DFA Canadian Vector Equity F (DFA600)
US Equity: 70% DFA US Core Equity F (DFA293) and 30% DFA US Vector Equity F (DFA223)
International Equity: 70% DFA International Core Equity F (DFA295) and 30% DFA International Vector Equity
F (DFA227)
Our estimates for the composition of expected returns are illustrated in Table 7. This data is reproduced in a
NaviPlan-compatible format in the Appendix.
