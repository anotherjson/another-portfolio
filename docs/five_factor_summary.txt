Introduction
Index funds are an increasingly popular and undoubtedly sensible tool for building investment
portfolios. The push toward index investing is based on the Efficient Market Hypothesis (EMH) (Fama,
1970), which simply states:
In general terms, the ideal is a market in which prices provide accurate signals for resource
allocation: that is, a market in which firms can make production-investment decisions, and
investors can choose among securities that represent ownership of firms’ activities under the
assumption that security prices at any time “fully reflect” all available information. A market in
which prices always “fully reflect” available information is called “efficient.”
If the market is efficient then prices contain all relevant information about the expected returns of a
stock at that point in time. Price changes will be based on new information, which cannot be predicted
reliably. In an efficient market it is not possible to earn reliable excess returns without taking on excess
risk. Excess returns without excess risk, known as alpha, is the goal of traditional active management.
Active management involves some combination of selecting a subset of stocks and timing the market
to generate alpha.
The consistent failure of active management to generate persistent alpha, as documented by
Carhartt (1997) and Fama and French (2010), supports market efficiency. As investors have become
increasingly aware of the empirical failure of active management, and its theoretical implications, they
have rightfully shifted their dollars toward low-cost broadly diversified index funds. This shift is sensible
given the pervasive evidence of market efficiency.
We would stop here to arrive at the conclusion that index investing is the smartest way for most people
to invest. If it is nearly impossible to consistently generate returns in excess of those associated with
taking on risk, then it is sensible to minimize costs and maintain long-term exposure to known risks.
Index investing using a market capitalization weighted index fund, like the iShares ETF XIC tracking the
S&P/TSX Composite index for Canadian stocks, offers low-cost exposure to market risk.
Since the introduction of the EMH as a falsifiable model in the mid-1960s, the field of asset pricing has
revealed other theoretically consistent and empirically robust risks that systematically affect asset prices,
independent of market risk. This is where an evidence-motivated investor may choose to diverge from
the basic concept of market capitalization weighted index investing. Rather than taking on only market
risk, it may be sensible to pursue long-term exposure to a combination of independent risks.
Considering the increasing correlations of global stock markets, exposure to multiple risk factors may
be even more beneficial than exposure to the stock markets of multiple countries. Combining risk
factor diversification with geographical diversification will provide investors with greater diversification
benefits than market capitalization weighted index funds alone. This paper will introduce the risk factors
included in a prominent asset pricing model, the Fama French Five-Factor Model, and the empirical
case to include exposure to these risk factors in portfolios. We will propose a model portfolio of ETFs
that aims to achieve exposure to all five independent risk factors.

Expected Stock Returns
Investing in a company’s stock means purchasing the rights to a portion of that company’s expected
future profits. The expected future profits are not guaranteed, so they are purchased at a discount.
If things work out as expected for the company then the shares deliver their portion of the expected
profits; the investment return is the difference between the discounted price paid for the expected profits
and the actual profits that accrue to the shares. That last sentence is extremely important: Expected
stock returns are not dictated by the profits that a company generates - they are dictated by the amount
that was paid for those profits. Investors will be willing to pay less for riskier future profits and more for
safer future profits. The documented relationship between risk and expected returns goes back to the
Capital Asset Pricing Model (CAPM) (Sharpe, 1964), the first asset pricing model.

2.1

Asset Pricing Models
In an efficient market asset prices fully reflect available information. Market efficiency is a theoretical
model, but it has stood the test of time as the best model that we have to understand how the financial
markets operate. If we accept that prices reflect all available information, then prices can be used to gain
insight into differences in expected returns between securities. Since the CAPM in 1964 there has been
an overwhelming amount of research conducted on asset pricing resulting in hundreds of documented
risk factors – independent risks that may contribute to the explanation of differences in expected returns.
Before going any further, it is important to note that asset pricing models do not prove or disprove market
efficiency. This must be true because any test of market efficiency using an asset pricing model is jointly
a test of market efficiency and a test of the asset pricing model - this is known as the joint hypothesis
problem. If an asset pricing model suggests that the market is not incorporating information into prices
it is impossible to say whether the market is inefficient, or the model is wrong. One of the most obvious
historical cases of the joint hypothesis problem in action is the empirical failure of the CAPM.

2.2

Market Beta: The Original Factor
Any discussion on asset pricing must start with market beta. Market beta is market risk as described
by the CAPM. The CAPM looks at the measure of sensitivity between an asset or portfolio and the
risk of the overall market. A market capitalization weighted equity index fund should have a market
beta of 1. A Portfolio consisting of 50% market cap weighted equity index fund and 50% cash
should have a market beta of 0.5. If the market goes up 10%, the portfolio with a beta of 1 would be
expected to go up 10%, while the portfolio with a beta of 0.5 would be expected to go up 5%.
If two portfolios with the same beta had different returns, the difference in returns could be attributed
to the portfolio manager’s ability to select securities and time the market, or to some as-yet
unidentified factor. A portfolio that delivers returns higher than expected based on its level of risk is
desirable. That excess risk-adjusted return is known as alpha; alpha is the holy grail of investing. The
CAPM was the foundation of asset pricing models – the first model to relate a measure of risk to
expected returns – but it is a severely flawed model. The CAPM is only able to explain about twothirds of the differences in returns between diversified portfolios.
PAGE 5

The CAPM was first shown to be flawed in Fischer Black’s 1972 paper Capital Market Equilibrium
with Restricted Borrowing. Rolf Banz followed up with his 1981 paper The Relationship Between
Return and Market Value of Common Stocks. Banz showed that small stocks had consistently higher
average returns that could not be explained by their market beta. In other words, viewed through the
CAPM lens, small stocks were generating persistent alpha. The CAPM took another blow in 1985
when Barr Rosenberg, Kenneth Reid, and Ronald Lanstein found that stocks with a high book value
relative to their market price (value stocks) had higher average returns that were not explained by
market beta. Their paper Persuasive Evidence of Market Inefficiency was further evidence that market
beta does not tell the full expected stock returns story.
Their findings, at the time, seemed to be proof that markets were not efficient. If some types of stocks
could have consistently higher returns without any additional risk, then the market is mispricing those
types of stocks. If that is in fact the case then markets are, by definition, not efficient. However, we
must remember the joint hypothesis theorem: a test of market efficiency using an asset pricing model
is jointly a test of market efficiency and a test of the asset pricing model. Was the market inefficient, or
did we need a better model?

2.3

The Fama-French Three-Factor Model
In 1992, Eugene Fama and Kenneth French pulled together the empirical anomalies that had
apparently been disproving the EMH and offered an alternative asset pricing model. They showed that
with a better model the market was not mispricing small cap and value stocks, it was pricing in the
independent risks of those types of stocks. Adding in the independent risks of small and value stocks
alongside market beta in the asset pricing model significantly increased the explanatory power of the
model and eliminated the empirical anomalies that had been making the market look inefficient from a
CAPM perspective.
Instead of explaining two-thirds of the difference in returns between diversified portfolios the threefactor model explains 90% of the difference. While it was a big leap forward, the Three-Factor
model is an empirical model without strong roots in financial theory. Fama and French had taken the
empirical observation that market risk was not sufficient to explain the returns of small cap and value
stocks and proposed a model with better explanatory power. The model still has known imperfections
and is only loosely tied to valuation theory.
Later research by Robert Novy-Marx (2013) and Titman, Wei, and Xie (2004) showed persistent
anomalies unexplained by the Three-Factor model: profitability and investment. Controlling for size
and relative price, firms with robust operating profitability tend to perform better than firms with weak
operating profitability, and firms with conservative asset growth tend to perform better than firms
with aggressive asset growth. These empirical anomalies caused financial economists to revisit the
Three-Factor model. Adding profitability and investment to the Three-Factor model not only increased
the explanatory power of the model, it brought the empirical asset pricing work closer in line with
valuation theory.

2.4

The Fama-French Five Factor-Model
The dividend discount model says that the theoretical value of a share of stock is the discounted
value of expected dividends per share.
mt =

∞

∑ E(d t+τ )⁄(1+r) τ

(1)

τ�1

Equation 1 shows that the stock price m t at time t is equal to the expected future dividends per

share, E(d t+τ ), discounted at the long-term average expected stock return r.

One of the problems with the dividend discount model is that not all firms pay dividends. Miller and
Modigliani (1961) showed that given investment policy, dividend policy is irrelevant to the valuation
of shares. With dividend policy irrelevance, the value of expected dividends is equal to expected
earnings minus expected investment. According to Miller and Modigliani (1961), the total market value
of the firm’s stock is given by Equation 2
Mt =

∞

∑ E(Y t+τ - dB t+τ )⁄(1+r) τ

(2)

τ�1

here Y t+τ is the earnings and dB t+τ is the expected change in book equity (asset growth). Scaling

both sides of Equation 2 by the book value of equity, B t , Equation 3 gives the theoretical valuation
equation as presented by Fama and French (2015).

∞
E(Y t+τ - dB t+τ )⁄(1+r) τ
M t ∑ τ=1
=
Bt
Bt

(3)

This theoretical valuation equation makes three statements about expected stock returns.
1. If we hold everything in Equation 3 constant except for the market value of the stock, M t , and

the expected stock return, r, then a lower ratio of M t ⁄B t must imply a higher expected stock

return. All else equal, a company with a lower price must have a higher discount rate.

2. If we hold everything in Equation 3 constant except for expected future earnings, Y t+τ , and
the expected stock return, r, then higher expected earnings must imply a higher expected
stock return. All else equal, if two companies trade at the same price, the company with
higher profits must have a higher discount rate. This is an expression of the profitability
premium.
3. If we hold everything in Equation 3 constant except for the expected growth in book value

of equity, dB t+τ , and the expected stock return, r, then higher expected asset growth must

imply a lower expected stock return. All else equal, if two companies trade at the same price,
the company with higher investment must have a lower discount rate. This is an expression of
the investment premium.

Measuring expected profitability and expected investment had been a challenge for many years.
In 2012, Robert Novy-Marx documented the finding that profitability, measured by gross profitsto-assets, adds further explanatory power to asset pricing models. He found that controlling for
gross profitability explains most earnings-related anomalies that the Three-Factor model had been
unable to explain. In 2013, Aharoni, Grundy, and Zeng documented a weaker but statistically reliable
relationship between asset growth and average returns. They found that firms with aggressive
investment policies, as measured by the growth in the book value of their assets, tend to have lower
average returns.
Informed by the theoretical valuation equation and the advances in measuring expected profitability
and expected investment, Fama and French proposed a five-factor asset pricing model in their 2015
paper A Five-Factor Asset Pricing Model. The five factors include market beta, company size, relative
price, gross profitability, and investment. The Five-Factor model is able to explain closer to 95% of the
differences in returns between diversified portfolios, and it is able to solve many of the anomalies left
unexplained by the Three-Factor model.
One of the most important insights that we gain from the valuation equation is that the factors should
not be considered in isolation. For example, a portfolio that focuses on profitability without controlling
for relative price is likely to result in a portfolio of growth stocks, and a portfolio that focuses on relative
price without controlling for profitability is likely to result in a portfolio of stocks with weak profitability.
Novy-Marx (2014) argues that buying stocks with robust profitability without paying premium prices
is just as much value investing as buying average profitability assets at discount prices. The stocks
with the highest expected returns in the market would tend to be the stocks with low relative prices
and robust profitability. This makes targeting value and profitability jointly one of the most important
aspects of managing a multi-factor portfolio.

2.5

Company Size
Company size was the original pricing anomaly. Interestingly, company size does not make an
explicit appearance in the theoretical valuation equation, and the standalone size premium has not
been statistically different from zero since publication of the effect by Banz (1981). It would be easy
to dismiss the inclusion of small cap stocks based on this information, but that would ignore one
of the other empirical realities: other factor premiums are much stronger in small cap stocks. Blitz
and Hanauer (2021) show empirically that there are powerful interaction effects between size and
other factors, such as value. They show that academic factor portfolios, which consist of 50% large
caps and 50% small caps, have significant alphas compared to factor portfolios constructed with
90% large caps and 10% small caps representing market capitalization weights. The conclusion is
that the interaction between size and other known factors may be a sufficient reason for long-only
investors to systematically overweight small-cap stocks, even if the size characteristic itself is not
rewarded with a premium.

2.6

Momentum
While the five factors in the Fama-French Five-Factor model fit nicely into a theoretical valuation
framework, momentum continues to be an unexplained anomaly, at least from an EMH perspective.
Momentum was first documented by Jegadeesh and Titman in their 1993 study Returns to Buying
Winners and Selling Losers: Implications for Stock Market Efficiency. It is the observed phenomenon
that stocks which have been increasing in price recently tend to continue increasing in price for a
short time, and stocks that have been decreasing in price tend to continue decreasing in price for a
short time.
In 1997 Mark Carhart combined the Fama-French Three-Factor model with momentum to create a
four-factor model. Adding momentum to the Three-Factor model further increased its explanatory
power. There are theoretical explanations from behavioral finance for the excess returns of stocks
with positive momentum. From a portfolio management perspective momentum is important when
considering a value strategy. Value stocks are stocks that have decreased in price to become value
stocks. Purchasing value stocks as they cross the value threshold ends up being a bet against
positive price momentum.

Historical Factor Premiums
Factors are characteristics that explain differences in returns between diversified portfolios. As seen
in the valuation equation they also have a theoretical relationship with expected returns. Small cap
and value stocks broke the CAPM because they had higher average returns than expected based on
their market betas. Stocks with robust profitability and stocks that invest conservatively had a similar
impact on the Three-Factor model.
As we will see, the higher average returns associated with all five factors in the Fama-French FiveFactor model have been persistent through time and pervasive across markets.

3.1

Defining a Factor Premium
Factors are technically defined as a portfolio that is long one group of assets and short another. The
market factor is the portfolio that is long the stock market and short one-month US treasury bills. The
size premium is the portfolio that is long small stocks and short large stocks. Mathematically, it is the
return of small stocks minus the return of big stocks; that is how the size factor gets the name small
minus big (SMB). The value factor is defined as the returns of high book-to-market stocks minus low
book-to-market stocks, or high minus low (HML). The profitability factor is firms with robust profitability
minus firms with weak profitability, or robust minus weak (RMW). The investment factor is firms that
invest conservatively minus firms that invest aggressively, or conservative minus aggressive (CMA).
Aggressive investment is also referred to as aggressive asset growth.
The academic factors are designed to disentangle the factors from each other. This is accomplished
by giving the academic factor equal weight contributions from big and small stocks. For example, the
academic value factor is defined in Equation 4.
HML =

1
1
(Small Value + Big Value)- (Small Growth + Big Growth).
2
2

(4)

In the context of assessing the existence of a single factor premium these academic factors may be
less relevant because the market portfolio has closer to a 10% value weight in small stocks and a

90% value weight in big stocks. Interestingly, Blitz and Hanauer (2021) compare the academic factor
portfolios to value weighted factor portfolios to demonstrate the additional excess return associated
with over-weighting small caps to increase the effectiveness of other factors. A market capitalization
weighted investor with a factor tilt toward value, high profitability, or low asset growth might be more
interested in the value weighted factor premiums, while an overweight small cap investor with a factor
tilt may be more interested in the academic factor premiums. Our model portfolio lands somewhere in
the middle with a roughly 30% weight in small stocks.
For the US we will present data on historical premiums using value weighted portfolios in addition to
the academic factor portfolios to demonstrate the difference in the magnitude of the premiums. Ken
French publishes US data on value weighted portfolios sorted by each factor. The data are calculated
as the top and bottom 30% of stocks sorted by each factor. For example, the value premium is
defined as the portfolio of the cheapest 30% of stocks minus the portfolio of the most expensive

PAGE 10
Five Factor Investing with ETFs

30%, and the small cap premium is the smallest 30% of stocks minus the largest 30%. These sorts
are similarly carried out for operating profitability and asset growth.
While demonstrating the difference in historical premiums between the academic factor portfolios
and the value weighted factor portfolios is important, the remainder of the paper will focus on the
academic factors.

3.2

US Data
The premiums associated with factor portfolios have been significant economically and, for the most
part, statistically.

These data are showing us that in the value weighted sample the market beat one-month treasury
bills by an annualized 5.37%, small stocks beat big stocks by 1.58%, cheap stocks beat expensive
stocks by 1.99%, stocks with robust operating profitability beat stocks with weak operating
profitability by 2.59%, and stocks with conservative asset growth beat stocks with aggressive asset
growth by 1.92%. Most of these premiums are statistically significant at the 95% confidence level
except for the value weighted premiums associated with smaller stocks over larger stocks with a
t statistic of 1.39 and value stocks over growth stocks with a t statistic of 1.80, and the academic
premium associated with smaller stocks over larger stocks with a t statistic of 1.85.
The academic value premium over the full sample is statistically significant, however over the more
recent sub-sample from 07/1990 through 06/2019 it is not statistically significant. The existence
of the US value premium has been questioned due to the recent run of historically severe underperformance that it has endured. This was addressed in a 2020 paper by Eugene Fama and Kenneth
French simply titled The Value Premium. They argue that there is too much noise in the data to
conclude that the value premium has ceased to exist since its initial publication.

3.3

Developed Ex-US Data
The developed ex-US evidence is not as statistically reliable as the US evidence. This may be partially
explained by a shorter time series of historical data and, for the market minus risk-free rate (MKT-RF)
premium, the recently poor performance of non-US developed market stocks. In this data set, the
value and profitability factors generated statistically reliable premiums at the 95% confidence level,
whereas market, size, and investment factors did not.

Emerging Markets Data
The emerging markets data similarly display less statistically reliable, though still economically
meaningful premiums. Here, the value and investment factors provided statistically significant
premiums to the 95% confidence level, whereas market, size, and profitability factors did not. Again,
the short time series of historical data should be noted as a likely partial explanation for reduced
statistical reliability.

The (un)Reliability of SMB
An interesting thread through these data, which speaks to the commentary in Section 2.5, is that the
standalone SMB premium has not been statistically different from zero in any of the regions and time
periods under examination. However, we know empirically that the other factors have been more
economically meaningful and statistically reliable in smaller capitalization companies. The important
implication for index investors is that a small cap index with no other factor loadings would not be
expected to reliably improve the expected outcome.

Explaining Differences in Returns
The long-short factor portfolios can be used to run multiple linear regression analysis in order to
determine what is driving the performance of a diversified portfolio. Considering the explanatory
power of the Five-Factor model, we would not expect a substantial portion of returns to be left
unexplained. Any unexplained portion of a portfolio’s return is alpha.

4.1

A Multifactor Index
To illustrate the explanatory power of the Five-Factor model we will observe the historical results of the
Dimensional US Core Equity Index. This is a retrospectively constructed index designed to target US
securities with an emphasis on companies with smaller capitalization, lower relative price, and higher
profitability, excluding those with the lowest profitability and highest relative price within the small cap
universe. The index also excludes those companies with the highest asset growth within the small
cap universe. An easy way to think about this index is that it is a US total market index with a slightly
higher weight in smaller, cheaper, and more profitable companies relative to the market, with an
exclusion for small cap growth companies with weak profitability that invest aggressively.
The index has delivered higher returns and higher risk-adjusted returns than the CRSP 1-10 Index,
which represents the market capitalization weighted US market.

While an annualized difference of 1.40% may not seem meaningful, over the full time period it results
in a large difference in ending wealth. With a starting $10,000 invested in 1963 the Dimensional
US Core Equity Index grew the asset to $3,209,000 by June 2020, while the CRSP 1-10 grew it to
$1,819,000.
If it is the case that exposure to the known factors explains the excess risk-adjusted returns of the
Dimensional US Core Equity Index relative to the CRSP 1-10 Index we would expect a multiple
linear regression to result in a high coefficient of determination1 and an alpha not statistically
different from zero.

The coefficient of determination, R2, is a measure of how well an observed outcome is explained by a model. It is based on the proportion of the total
variation of outcomes explained by the model.

As expected, we see a coefficient of determination of 99.73%, leaving almost none of the monthly
variation in returns unexplained by the model, and an alpha that is not statistically different from
zero. The fund has statistically significant loadings to the factors in the Five-Factor model. There are
no surprises here considering that this index has been constructed specifically to capture the factor
premiums.
If we were to compare the Dimensional US Core Equity Index to a market index like the CRSP 1-10
considering only their historical risk-adjusted returns from a CAPM perspective, the Dimensional index
looks significantly better than the CRSP 1-10 index. Before multi-factor asset pricing models like the
Five-Factor model, this performance difference could command a high fee – it would look like alpha.
However, with the Five-Factor model it is possible to see that the performance can be systematically
implemented through an index fund. The excess returns are no longer alpha; they are fully explained
by the risk exposures of the index.

4.2

Dividend Growth Investing
Examining an index that has been designed to capture the factor premiums had a predictable result.
The same analysis can be applied to strategies like dividend growth investing. It is easy to make the
empirical observation that dividend growth stocks have matched the market’s returns while being less
volatile. Take the Vanguard Dividend Appreciation ETF, VIG, as an example. From June 2006 through
June 2020 VIG delivered nearly identical annualized returns and higher CAPM risk-adjusted returns
than the Vanguard Total Stock Market ETF, VTI.

With the empirical observation alone there seems to be a link between dividend growth and risk
adjusted stock returns. Are dividends special, or is there another explanation? By nature of the fact
that they pay consistent and growing dividends, it is sensible to think that dividend growth stocks
are likely to be larger stocks with robust profitability that reinvest conservatively – robust profits and
conservative investment should result in the cash to pay consistently growing dividends. It would also
be reasonable to expect companies with long histories of growing their dividends to have low prices
relative to the book value of their assets – growth stocks with high prices relative to their book value
do not tend to be dividend growth stocks.
The results are consistent with these expectations. In a Fama-French Five-Factor regression on VIG
we see a coefficient of determination of 94.80% - the model explains 94.80% of the fund’s monthly
variation in returns. We see negative loading to the size factor and slight negative loading to the
value factor. The slight negative loading to the size and value factors is expected based on the higher
loading to the profitability factor alongside no controls for size and relative price. All these factor
loadings are statistically significant at the 95% confidence level. We also see a negative alpha that is
not statistically different from 0 at the 95% confidence level.

The ability of the historical long-short premiums in the Five-Factor model to explain differences in
returns is powerful. Dividend growth investing is not the only case study. In the 2014 paper Dissecting
Anomalies with a Five-Factor Model, Fama and French show that the higher average returns
associated with low market beta, share repurchases, and low volatility are all well-explained by the
Five-Factor model.
With its factor exposures it may seem that VIG is a reasonable ETF choice to capture the risk
premiums in the Five-Factor model. The problem? The portfolio has a negative loading to both
the size and value factors. More intentional portfolio construction, as opposed to the naïve factor
exposures gained from a dividend growth focus, could solve this problem.

Persistence of the Premiums
We have seen the available historical data in full, which are compelling. However, looking at the full
historical period means that we are not observing any sub-periods where the factor premiums may
have been negative.

5.1

Rolling Historical Periods
If we look at 10-year rolling periods with a one-month step interval for US stocks from July 1963
through April 2020, SMB has been positive in 72% of rolling 10-year periods, HML has been positive
in 86% of 10-year rolling periods, RMW has been positive in 86% of 10-year rolling periods, and the
market has beaten treasury bills in 81% of rolling 10-year periods. Over 20-year periods the data are
even more compelling. The following table summarizes the percent of historical rolling 10 and 20-year
time periods where Five-Factor premiums were positive.

Reflecting on the data, we see that HML, RMW, and CMA have been more consistent at delivering a
positive premium than the market over 10-year rolling historical periods.
Similar data are observed for global ex-US Developed stocks starting July 1990 and Emerging
Markets stocks starting July 1992, both ending June 2020. There are not enough data for a
meaningful 20-year rolling period comparison in these cases.

While the persistence over rolling periods alone is of some interest, the relative timing of positive
premiums may be more important. When one premium has been negative, at least one of the others
has tended to be positive in the sample. The chart below shows the 10-year rolling MKT, SMB, HML,
RMW, and CMA premiums for US stocks from July 1963 through June 2020.

correlations with each other, as seen in the following tables.

Waiting for the Premiums
One of the casual arguments against adding additional risk factors to portfolios is that the risk factors
may take a long time to pay off. That is true - we have seen that there are historical 10-year periods with
negative premiums for all the factors in the Five-Factor model. The current time period is an example;
US value stocks have underperformed US growth stocks for more than 10 years at the time of writing.
This experience is not a reason to avoid value stocks. The market premium has similarly had 10-year
periods of underperformance in the past. When the market went through those periods, the size and
value premiums were generally positive. It should be apparent in Figure 1 that this recent period is
unusual relative to history with the market risk premium dominating while other premiums struggle.
A recent example of the market going through a prolonged period of underperformance is US stocks
for the 10-year period ending July 2009. Over that time period the US stock market represented by
the CRSP 1-10 index lost an annualized 0.19% while the Fama/French US Small Value Research
Index returned an annualized 9.51%, the Fama/French US Value Research Index returned an
annualized 3.78%, the Fama/French US High Profitability Research Index returned an annualized
2.09%, and one-month US Treasury Bills returned an annualized 2.95%. The growth of $1 in each of
these indices over the 10-year time period is illustrated in Figure 2.

This is far from an isolated incident. There were 111 10-year periods ending between July 1973 and
June 2020 where the US market premium was negative. Over those same 111 periods where the
market premium was negative, SMB, HML, and CMA were all positive, while RMW was negative in 53
of the 111 periods.
The single worst time to retire in the US stock market data was December 1968. From then until
January 1984, the US market gained an annualized 7.26%, but trailed one-month US Treasury Bills
which returned an annualized 7.63%, and barely beat inflation which ran at an annualized 7.22%.
Over the same time period, the Fama/French US Small Value Research Index returned 15.80%
annualized, and the Fama/French US Value Research Index returned 13.46% annualized.
A more extreme example is Japan from July 1990 through December 2019. Over the full period the
Japanese stock market measured by the Fama/French Japan Market Index delivered an annualized
return of 2.36%, trailing one-month US Treasury Bills which returned 2.63%. The Fama/French
Japan High Profitability Index delivered similar performance at an annualized 2.27%. Meanwhile,
the Dimensional Japan Small Cap Value Index and the Fama/French Japan Value Index delivered
annualized returns of 5.43% and 7.96% respectively. The growth of $1 in each of these Japanese
indices from 1990 to 2019 is illustrated in Figure 3.

The statement that equity risk factors may take a long time to deliver their premiums is true, but
the market risk premium is not immune to those periods of underperformance. In fact, the market
has historically been less reliable at delivering positive 10-year premiums than most of the other risk
factors. Combining multiple risk premiums together in a portfolio not only increases expected returns,
it adds independent sources of expected returns which may show up at different times to increase
the reliability of the long-term outcome.
Understanding the evidence is important – it is only useful if it can be applied to practical portfolio
construction.

Five-Factor Investing with ETFs
Product availability has been one of the biggest constraints for investors wishing to capture multiple
risk premiums in a low-cost and well-diversified portfolio. Dimensional Fund Advisors has been
implementing empirical asset pricing anomalies and asset pricing theory into investment portfolios for
as long as the evidence and theory have existed – Dimensional launched their first product coincident
with Banz’ 1981 paper. Unfortunately for DIY ETF investors, Dimensional has only recently filed for
a handful of ETFs and otherwise restricts access to their mutual funds to institutions and clients of
certain investment firms.

6.1

Product Availability
In our March 2019 paper Factor Investing with ETFs, we demonstrated that many funds labeled as
“multifactor” fail to deliver meaningful exposure to the desired characteristics, especially after costs. A
possible explanation for the observed “light” risk factor exposure in many retail products is that fund
companies want to minimize their funds’ tracking error relative to the capitalization weighted index to
avoid volatile asset flows.
In that paper we proposed a portfolio with exposure to US value through the iShares Core S&P U.S.
Value ETF and US small cap value through the iShares S&P Small-Cap 600 Value ETF to gain access
to some of the known risk factors. That portfolio intentionally targeted size and value in the US while
ignoring US profitability and investment based on a lack of low-cost, well-diversified, and low turnover
product availability; outside of the US, factors were ignored entirely for the same reason.
More recently Avantis Investors launched ETF products that, in broad terms, mirror the approach
of Dimensional Fund Advisors. Using these products, we have constructed a model portfolio
that is designed to approximate the characteristics of the portfolios that we use for our wealth
management clients.

6.2

Approach to Obtaining Factor Exposure
One of the fundamental portfolio management decisions required when constructing a portfolio
designed to capture multiple risk factors is whether the desired factors will be targeted across the
full spectrum of market capitalizations (small, mid, large) or targeted only in small caps. Targeting a
given level of factor exposure across the full spectrum of capitalizations results in less concentration in
individual securities, which is desirable. There is strong evidence from Bessembinder (2018) and Dai and
Wicker (2018) that more concentrated portfolios are increasingly likely to underperform especially over
long periods of time due to the skewness in individual stock returns. However, the products available
for Canadians to target risk factors are listed on US exchanges, adding additional complexity and cost
to the portfolio management process. To manage these trade-offs, we have taken the approach of
combining US listed small cap value funds with Canadian listed market capitalization weighted funds for
this model portfolio. Our ideal portfolio is factor tilted across the full spectrum of market capitalizations,
but we believe that given the other considerations this is a reasonable trade-off.

PAGE 21
Five Factor Investing with ETFs

One of the biggest considerations for investors implementing this strategy is that the concentrated
nature of the factor exposure may result in behavioral challenges to sticking with the strategy. At
the portfolio level volatility should not be materially different from a market capitalization weighted
portfolio, but the small cap value holdings on their own are likely to exhibit higher volatility.

6.3

Avantis ETFs
It is important to note that as the Avantis products are relatively new there is insufficient historical
live fund data to perform meaningful analysis on them. Instead, we are using a combination of
hypothetical back-tested data net of fund fees and live fund data where it is available. Back-tested
data tends to look good, often better than comparable live fund data. However, back-test data should
still provide insight for our purpose of evaluating the fund strategies’ exposure to the risk factors that
we want to target in portfolios.
We will use five-factor regression based on the Fama French Five-Factor model to estimate factor
exposure. Regression outputs tell us how much of a factor premium a fund would have historically
captured. Alpha in the regressions is the component of fund returns that was not explained by factor
exposure. It may have come from security selection, market timing, rebalancing, or exposure to some
as-yet unknown factor that is not included in the Five-Factor model.
In addition to back-tested returns data and regression outputs we will examine the characteristics of
each fund relative to a capitalization-weighted total market benchmark.

AVUV
AVUV is the Avantis U.S. Small Cap Value ETF. This fund is intended to be a US small cap ETF that
emphasizes cheaper and more profitable companies within the small cap universe. AVUV has a
management fee of 0.25%. Relative to the US total market, AVUV is substantially smaller and contains
lower priced stocks.

Proposed Equity Model Portfolio
Based on the information presented in this paper, it would seem sensible to target multiple risk factors
in a portfolio. In order to accomplish factor exposure without making things too complicated we
propose a 6 ETF equity portfolio consisting of primarily Canadian listed ETFs. Our factor exposure
comes from AVUV and AVDV, both US listed ETFs. A feature of this model is that it lends itself to
easy adaptation for RRSP tax efficiency using US listed ETFs; VUN, XEF, and XEC have US listed
counterparts (VTI, IEFA, and IEMG) which would increase the portfolio’s tax efficiency in an RRSP
account without affecting the portfolio’s overall asset class exposures presented in Factor Investing
with ETFs (2019) by adding exposure to International small cap value stocks, and by using funds that
consider all five factors as opposed to only three of them. It does however give up exposure to large
and mid-cap value in an effort to keep things simple.

Appendix B - Backtest data and Index
Methodologies
The backtested Avantis performance results provided here are largely hypothetical (until October, 2019).
Hypothetical performance results have many inherent limitations. Hypothetical trading does not involve financial
risk, and no hypothetical trading record can completely account for the impact of financial risk in actual trading.
In addition, the hypothetical performance results do not represent actual recommendations or trading decisions,
and they may not reflect the impact that economic and market factors might have had on the investment
decision-making. For example, the ability to withstand losses or to adhere to a particular trading program in
spite of losses can adversely affect actual results. There are numerous other factors related to the markets
in general or to the implementation of any specific trading program that cannot be fully accounted for in the
preparation of hypothetical performance results, but which can adversely affect actual results.
No representation is being made that any account will or is likely to achieve profits or losses similar to those
shown. In fact, there are frequently sharp differences between hypothetical performance results and actual
results. Backtested performance results do not represent the results of actual trading using client assets
but were achieved by means of the retroactive application of a hypothetical portfolio that was designed with
the benefit of hindsight. The hypothetical performance results should not be considered indicative of any
actual performance results, or of any results that could be attained by clients. Backtested performance is
no guarantee of future results. The hypothetical strategy performance was calculated using historical US
company data on a monthly basis with annual reconstitutions and assuming dividend reinvestments. The
hypothetical strategy focuses on securities of companies in the small cap universe that have high equity to
price and high profitability. Returns are gross of fees and do not assume any trading costs.
The Dimensional International Small Cap Value Index has been retrospectively calculated by Dimensional
Fund Advisors and did not exist prior to April 2008. Accordingly, the results shown during the periods prior
to April 2008 do not represent actual returns of the Index. The calculation methodology for the Dimensional
International Small Cap Value Index was amended in January 2014 to include profitability as a factor in
selecting securities for inclusion in the index. The calculation methodology for the Dimensional International
Small Cap Value Index was amended in November 2019 to include asset growth as a factor in selecting
securities for inclusion in the index. The Dimensional International Small Cap Value Index consists of small
cap companies in eligible markets whose relative price is in the bottom 35% of their country’s respective
constituents, after the exclusion of utilities and companies with either negative or missing relative price data.
The index excludes securities with the lowest profitability within their country’s small cap universe. The index
also excludes those companies with the highest asset growth within their country’s small cap universe.
Profitability is defined as operating income before depreciation and amortization minus interest expense
divided by book equity. Asset growth is defined as change in total assets from the prior fiscal year to current
fiscal year. The index monthly returns are computed as the simple average of the monthly returns of four subindices, each one reconstituted once a year at the end of each quarter of the year. Maximum index weight
of any one company is capped at 5%. Countries currently included are Australia, Austria, Belgium, Canada,
Denmark, Finland, France, Germany, Hong Kong, Ireland, Israel, Italy, Japan, Netherlands, New Zealand,
Norway, Portugal, Singapore, Spain, Sweden, Switzerland, and United Kingdom. Exclusions: REITs and

Investment Companies. Dimensional Index data compiled by Dimensional.

Using US listed ETFs as a Canadian investor has some unique tax implications that need to be considered.
When a dividend is paid by a company to a foreign shareholder, the country of origin will typically withhold
some tax. For example, a Japanese company paying a dividend to a Canadian shareholder would result
in some tax being withheld before the dividend leaves Japan. There are two levels of foreign withholding
tax that a Canadian resident investor may experience. Level 1 withholding tax is withheld by the source
country – Japan in the previous example. Level 2 withholding tax occurs when the Japanese stock is
owned inside of a US listed ETF. In that case Japan withholds tax before paying the dividend to the US
shareholder (the ETF) and then the US withholds tax when the ETF pays the dividend to the Canadian
unitholder. US withholding tax is 15% for a Canadian investor who has certified their Canadian residency
using the form W-8 BEN. Foreign non-US withholding tax for a US resident (the US listed ETF’s residency)
is closer to 8-9% on average across foreign developed countries and 14-15% for emerging markets.
Estimating the average foreign withholding tax rate in an international developed or emerging markets ETF
is accomplished by examining the fund’s annual report. Depending on the account type and the underlying
ETF structure, different levels of foreign withholding tax can be expected.
